          <h3 className="policy-heading">HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION &amp; WHY</h3>
          <p>
            This section explains how we use your information and the legal grounds (or purposes)
            for which we use it. Some purposes are primary purposes that are necessary in order for
            us to provide our services or products or to fulfill our legal obligations. Other
            secondary purposes aren&apos;t strictly necessary to provide our services but provide
            additional value and are therefore typically subject to your choices.
          </p>

          <h4 className="policy-heading">1. For the performance of our contract with you</h4>
          <p>
            When you make purchases. We use your information when transact with us (such as VIP
            experiences or merchandise) so we can:
          </p>

          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Event Partner(s). We share your information with Event Partner(s) who provide services
              for the event such as co-promoters, ticketing agents, artists or venues to enable them
              to run the event on our behalf, allocate seating or notify you if there has been a
              change to the event or provide important event information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contest, Competitions and Referrals. When you enter into competitions or similar prize
              draws, we use your information to confirm your registration and to communicate to you
              about your entry. If you give us your friend&apos;s information, for example, via our
              referral service to tell a friend about our website or to purchase a gift card, we
              will only use your friend&apos;s information to provide services you requested. Your
              friend may contact us to ask us using the details below to delete their information.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="policy-heading">2. Subject to your choices</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Marketing. To contact you with information or offers regarding upcoming events,
              products or services via email, push and web notification, SMS, or on social media
              platforms. You can change your marketing preferences at any time&apos; see the section
              &quot;Your choices and rights&quot; below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertising &amp; cookies. To deliver tailored advertising and marketing communications
              on our websites and apps depending on your market. (See our Cookies Policy for more
              information).
            </li>
            <li>
              Market research &amp; fan feedback. To conduct market research and analysis which helps
              improve and customise our products and services, or to contact you with satisfaction
              surveys, or to participate in user research (such as focus groups). We include an
              unsubscribe option for this kind of contact should you no longer wish to receive them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Images. Where you attend our events, we sometimes take photos and sometimes post these
              on social media or use them in marketing campaigns. Our signage at the event will let
              you know, and you can always request we remove you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personalization. To make sure our messages and website are relevant to you (depending
              on your market). For example, when you &apos;favorite&apos; certain artists and genres,
              purchase tickets, attend shows with friends and sign up for presales, we will inform
              you about similar events we think you might be interested in. We create a user profile
              with the information we have and how you use our services. By turning personalization
              off you won&apos;t get any personal recommendations and any newsletters you&apos;ve subscribed
              to will be generic (although if you&apos;ve asked to receive alerts about specific artists
              or venues, you&apos;ll still receive these). We will still perform profiling activities
              where we need to do so to deliver our services to you, for example for fraud screening
              purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Location-based services. For example, our apps request location permission for
              functions like browsing events near you, receiving push notifications about them or
              seeing yourself on the map at an event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Crowd management analytics. Some of our apps use crowd management software so we can
              see how many people are at a particular stage, or when the busiest times at the bars
              are. This helps us more efficiently allocate our resources. We turn this on shortly
              before the festival or event and turn it off shortly after so we&apos;re not tracking
              devices when we don&apos;t need to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Accessibility. To process your health information to meet your accessibility
              requirements, where specifically required and explicit consent is provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              Commercial Partners. We sometimes work with Commercial Partners who we share
              information with. These are third party data controllers that we work with to provide
              additional value-add services, such as our travel packages, sponsors or exclusive
              presale deals. In some circumstances, where sharing is not necessary for us to perform
              the contract, you have requested, we will ask for your permission.
            </li>
          </ul>

              otherwise permitted by law. For example, making sure tickets get into the hands of
              real fans and to provide a secure platform. As such, we may use your information to
              prevent ticket touting, misuse of our intellectual property (e.g., our or our Event

            As a global company, our fans are located all over the world. Depending on your market,
            there are specific laws and regulations around privacy rights such as the GDPR in
            Europe, LGPD in Brazil and CCPA in United States etc. You may designate an authorized

            authorized agent to be considered verified, you must provide the authorized agent with
            a signed, written affidavit to make such requests, or a power of attorney. We may need
            to follow up with you to verify your identity or authorization before processing an
            agent&apos;s request. If you do not follow these instructions we may not be able to process

              restricted from further use. The right to delete or erase your account cannot be made
              where you have a ticket or transaction for a future event. A deletion of your account

            period for actioning a right may differ according to your place of residence and we may
            not always have to comply. When this happens, we will explain why.
          </p>

          <h3 className="policy-heading">LOOKING AFTER YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
          <p>
            We have security measures in place to protect your information. The security measures
            we use will depend on the type of information collected. If you think that an
            unauthorized account has been created using your name, contact us. We are not
            responsible for third party websites and apps. If you click on a third-party link, you
            will be taken to websites we do not control. This policy does not apply to the privacy
            practices of those websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            We only keep your information for as long as required to provide you with the services
            you request, for the purposes outlined in this policy and for any legal purposes for
            which we are obliged to keep the information. For example, we retain certain purchase
            information for accounting and tax purposes even after you have deleted your account.
            Our retention rules are dependent on whether the information is necessary to provide
            the product or service, what consents have been provided around the use of personal
            information and what statutory, contractual, or other legal obligations do we have to
            retain personal information. We will securely delete your information when it is no
            longer required for these purposes, in line with our company policies.
          </p>

          <h3 className="policy-heading">Transfers of your personal information</h3>
          <p>
            As a part of a global group of companies headquartered in the United States, we
            sometimes need to transfer your information outside of your country of residency. This
            occurs where:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We rely on shared services provided by the Bizarro group of companies, some of which
              may be located outside of the country where you are resident. For example, our global
              platform is designed and maintained primarily from the United States and the United
              Kingdom.
            </li>
            <li>
              When world-class acts are touring, in order to provide you a seamless experience,
              your information may be transferred internationally if that is not based in your
              country of residence.
            </li>
            <li>
              We use global service providers, such as the ones described above.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When transferring information, there are strict rules in place to ensure your
            information is still protected to the highest standard. Where we do this, we will
            ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place. Where your information is
            transferred outside of your local market, we use contractual measures and internal
            mechanisms requiring the recipient to comply with privacy standards of the exporter. We
            will use contractual clauses, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the
            European Commission and other Regulatory Bodies where applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more information, or to get a copy of the relevant documentation please contact us
            at hello@bizarro.life.
          </p>
          <p>
            There&apos;s also your local Supervisory Authority where you have one, although we encourage
            you to try and let us help you first.
          </p>
          <p>
            From time to time we may change our privacy practices. We will notify you of any
            material changes to this policy as may be required by law. We will also post an updated
            copy on our website. Please check our site periodically for updates.

          <h3 className="policy-heading">Online Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            We and our third-party partners use online technologies in order to deliver a more
            user-friendly experience. These online technologies can include cookies, pixels or web
            beacons or tags, scripts, SDKs and tags. A cookie is a data file that your browser sets
            on your device, which contains information about your online activity, pixels or web
            beacon or tags are pixel graphics or tags that track web traffic, conversions and

          <p>
            Online tracking technologies are either first party (i.e., managed by us) or third-party
            (developed by external parties). The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer
            depends on whether it is a persistent or session cookie. Session cookies are temporary
            until you leave the website or close your browser. Persistent cookies stay until they

            displayed when viewing the cookie in the preference centre.
          </p>

          <h3 className="policy-heading">Categories of online technologies</h3>
          <p>Online technologies can be categorised into the following five groups:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Strictly necessary: These are required for the website to function and operate and
              enable technical functionality and provide services requested by you. For example,
              setting of country and language preferences, keeping you logged in during your visit,
              security and fraud prevention. Strictly necessary cookies cannot be disabled and do
              not require consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance: These help us to count visits and traffic to websites so we can measure
              and improve the performance of our websites. These tracking technologies collect
              information that is aggregated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Functional: These enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and
              personalisation. They may be set by us or by our third-party partners whose services
              we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these technologies, then some or all
              of our services may not function properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertising &amp; Targeting: These may be either be our or our third-party partners to
              learn more about your interests including which products and services you are
              interested in or have purchased on any of our websites and apps. We and our partners
              use this information to show you more personalised marketing and product
              recommendations based on your interests and behaviour. If you do not allow these
              technologies, you will experience less targeted advertising by us and our third-party
              partners.
            </li>
            <li>
              Social: These may be used to enable you to share our content with your friends and
              networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other websites and building
              up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on
              other websites you visit. If you do not allow these technologies you may not be able
              to use or see these sharing tools.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            For more information and choice of which type of vendors and category per online
            technology, please see the cookie preference centre available on all our websites and
            apps under &quot;Manage my cookies&quot;.
          </p>

          <h3 className="policy-heading">How to manage online technologies on our websites and apps</h3>
          <h4 className="policy-heading">Browser Settings</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to our preference centre, most browsers will enable you to manage your
            cookies preferences e.g., have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or
            use it to disable cookies altogether. If you do decide to disable or delete these
            altogether some sites will not work as well, as they rely on online technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not wish to allow us and third-party organisations to use online technologies
            within our emails, such as pixel tags, the best way to do this is not to enable images
            when you view our emails. In other words, only view the plain text of the email. Some
            web browsers and email clients have settings or extensions available to disable / block
            such cookies such as Gmail.
          </p>

          <h4 className="policy-heading">Ad Choices</h4>
          <p>
            When you see an Ad Choices icon on any advertising whether from us or a third party you
            can follow the link for more information about behavioural advertising practices please
            visit https://youradchoices.com/
          </p>
          <p>
            The Digital Advertising Alliance also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of
            cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising. To exercise choice for
            companies participating in this tool, download the AppChoices app.
